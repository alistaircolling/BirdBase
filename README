// TODO

1. Framework bootstrap could be cleaner - running around building paths from locales, flashvars and preferences 
has plenty of room for confusion.

2. New views for everything.

3. A way to get around the new TLF layout issues when using TLF on a textField in the Flash IDE and exporting that
library. Text Fields seem to default to the TLF layout in the Flash IDE, but when exported, the whole thing chokes
when being loaded in - there's a security issue involved, it seems.


// TINGS

Preferences are a place to hold info you may need later. Such as the name of the correct asset that you wish to load.

This works cloned out of the box, follow the logger statements to see what's going on during bootstrap.
